## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2023-12-13

I'm excited to announce ODMantic v1.0.0, with Pydantic v2 support! üéâ

This release brings a range of changes that are aligned with the new Pydantic architecture.
Keeping a maintainable and healthy codebase was especially important.
Thus from now on, ODMantic will not support Python 3.7, Pydantic V1, and Motor 2.x anymore.

Overall, integrating with Pydantic v2 brings around **30% performance improvements** on
common operations. ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è

We have a lot of room to improve the performance further now that we only support Pydantic v2.
There is also a 300% üëÄ improvement on the bulk saves crafted by @tiangolo that will be merged soon! üöÄ

Special thanks to @tiangolo for his help on this release and for saving me a lot of time
figuring out a particularly annoying bug!

Check out the **[migration guide](https://art049.github.io/odmantic/migration_guide/)** to
upgrade your codebase and enjoy this new release!

### Breaking changes

- Support for Python 3.7, Pydantic v1 and Motor 2.x has been dropped

- `Optional[T]` doesn't have a `None` implicit default value anymore

- `Model.copy` doesn't support the `exclude` and `include` kwargs anymore

- `odmantic.Field` doesn't accept extra kwargs anymore since it's slated to be removed in Pydantic

- The `Config` class is no longer supported and the `model_config` dict should be used instead

- `DocumentParsingError` is no longer a subclass of `ValidationError`

- The `__bson__` class method is no longer supported to define BSON encoders on custom types. The new method to customize BSON encoding is to use the `WithBSONSerializer` annotation.

- Decimals (`decimal.Decimal` and `bson.Decimal128`) are now serialized as strings in JSON documents

- Custom JSON encoders(defined with the `json_encoders` config option) are no longer effective on `odmantic.bson` types. Annotated types with `pydantic.PlainSerializer` should be used instead.



### Removals

- `AIOEngineDependency` has been removed since it was deprecated in v0.2.0 in favor of a global engine object

- Defining the collection with `__collection__` has been removed since it was deprecated in v0.3.0 in favor of the `collection` config option


### Deprecations

_We comply with the new Pydantic method naming, prefixing them with `model_`_

- `Model.dict` has been deprecated in favor of `Model.model_dump`

- `Model.doc` has been deprecated in favor of `Model.model_dump_doc`

- `Model.parse_doc` has been deprecated in favor of `Model.model_validate_doc`

- `Model.update` has been deprecated in favor of `Model.model_update`

- `Model.copy` has been deprecated in favor of `Model.model_copy`
